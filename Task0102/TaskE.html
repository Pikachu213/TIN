    <h2>Cleaning up</h2>

    <p>Today, Indian streets are trash-free. Most waste is segregated and more than 450 garbage trucks make daily door-to-door collections, tracked from a central control room. Householders hand over both gila (wet) and sukha (dry) trash in separate lots. What can be recycled is sold to recycling companies and much of what remains is used in the construction of roads. Organic waste is converted into usable products like compost or fuel. But Indore’s success isn’t mirrored by all states. For many cities at the other end of the ranking - such as Beed in Maharashtra, Chennai in Tamil Nadu, and Agra in Uttar Pradesh - waste management remains a challenge.

    <h2>Situation</h2>

    <p> A major public awareness campaign was launched to teach residents about responsible waste management and help them change their behaviour. Despite this, the programme initially met with some resistance. “When the waste segregation began, 80% of people would not segregate waste”, Gautam Kaneria, an Indore garbage truck driver, told IndiaSpend. “We would explain to them why they had to this, and plead with them. If people repeatedly gave unsegregated trash, we would let our supervisors know and fine those households.”</p>
